# Covid Shiny: The 2019-20 Coronavirus Pandemic visualized  with R and Shiny
Covid Shiny uses the data from Johns Hopkins University to visualize the outbreak of the novel coronavirus. The data is available from [this repository](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data).

You can scroll through the story so far, look at the countries currently leading in various statistics and view the figures on a world map.

The app uses the [mapbox API](https://docs.mapbox.com/api/). If you have an API key, save it in a **key.env** file that looks like this:
```{bash}
MAPBOX_KEY=YOUR_SECRET_API_KEY
```
If you do not have such a key, the app will display a dark basemap from carto.
# Run it on your machine
You can run Covid Shiny on your own machine using the following code:
```R
packages = c(
	"data.table", "dotenv", "dplyr", "english", "forecast", "fresh", "highcharter", "htmltools", "leaflet",
	"leaflet.extras", "plotly", "quantmod", "readr", "sass", "sf", "shiny", "shinyanimate", "shinybusy",
	"shinyjs", "shinyWidgets", "stringr", "waiter"
	)
install.packages(packages, repos = "https://cran.rstudio.com/")
library(shiny)
runGitHub("covid_shiny", "nicoFhahn")
```
